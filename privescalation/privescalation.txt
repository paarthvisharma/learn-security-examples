In privilege escalation vulnerability, in this case when looking at the insecure file, we observer that a non-admin user can demote an admin to a regular user without proper authorization checks. It's important to implement stringent authentication and authorization checks for carrying out such activities. This is fixed in the secure code.
We need to ensure that every user session is authenticated and utilize secure authentication methods, such as OAuth or JWT tokens, to verify the identity of users upon login. This step ensures that only legitimate users gain access to the system.
